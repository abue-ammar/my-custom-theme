## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm
- Visual Studio Code

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abue-ammar/nebula-midnight-theme.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd nebula-midnight-theme

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Package the theme
npm run build
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Package the theme into a .vsix file
- `npm run install` - Install the packaged theme in VS Code
- `npm run publish` - Publish the theme to the VS Code Marketplace
- `npm run package` - Alternative command to package the theme

## üöÄ Releases

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated releases. Every time you push to the `master` branch, a new release is automatically created with the latest `.vsix` file.

Users can download the latest `.vsix` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/abue-ammar/nebula-midnight-theme/releases).

### How It Works

1. **Push to master** - Any push to the master branch triggers the build workflow
2. **Automatic build** - The extension is built using Node.js 22
3. **Automatic release** - A new GitHub release is created with the current version from `package.json`
4. **Download ready** - Users can immediately download the `.vsix` file

### Creating a New Version

1. Update the version in `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0.1"
   }
   ```

2. Update any version references in scripts and files

3. Commit and push to master:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.1"
   git push origin master
   ```

4. The release will be created automatically!

### Manual Release (Alternative)

You can still create manual releases using:

#### Method 1: Using the release script

```bash
./release.sh
```

#### Method 2: Using Git tags

```bash
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

The GitHub Action will automatically:

- Build the `.vsix` file
- Create a release (if using tag method)
- Upload the `.vsix` file to the release
- Generate installation instructions

### Automated Workflows

- **Build & Test**: Runs on every push and pull request to ensure the theme builds correctly
- **Release**: Triggered on new releases or version tags, automatically builds and uploads the `.vsix` file
